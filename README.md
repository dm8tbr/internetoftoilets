IoT - in this case short for Internet of Toilets

See it in action: https://twitter.com/IoToilets/

A quickly put together showcase for a "thing" on the Internet. Aside from the PR and comedic effect of the twitter posting functionality, I'll be adding MQTT over IPv6 and or 6LoWPAN and a "big data" backend.

I do more than just engineering and system/service architecture. Also I'm looking for a job.
